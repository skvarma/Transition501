# SFDC ADV Developer Transition Exam - Study Notes

### Topic#1 - Describe the capabilities of base-system objects such as sharing objects, history objects, metadata objects, multi-currency, and Chatter objects.

#### Sharing Objects
Apex managed sharing is a type of "Programatic Sharing" which allows you to define a custom sharing reason to associate with your programatic share. Standard Salesforce objects support "Programatic Sharing" while custom objects support Apex managed sharing. More specifically, object shares can be written to both standard and custom objects, however custom sharing reasons can only be defined for shares written to custom objects.

All objects that have a default sharing setting of the either "Private" or "Public Read Only" also have a related "Share" object that is similar to an access control list (ACL) found in other platforms. All share objects for custom objects are named as MyCustomObject__Share

A share object includes records supporting all three types of sharing: Force.com managed sharing, user managed sharing, and Apex managed sharing.

A custom objectâ€™s share object allows four pieces of information to be defined:
  - The record being shared.
  - The User or Group with whom the object is being shared.
  - The permission level being granted to the User or Group.
  - The reason why the User or Group has been granted sharing access.

Reasons to implement Apex Sharing
  - Sharing records created by Apex managed sharing are maintained across record owner changes.
  - The only users that can add, edit or delete sharing records created by Apex managed sharing are users with the "Modify All Data" permission.
  - A record can be shared multiple times with a user or group using different Apex sharing reasons.

Sample Use Case
  - Automatically share a record to a User based on a User-lookup field.
    e.g. Share a record based on a user lookup that is on the object.


#### History objects
The naming convention for these objects is:
__[standardObjectName]History e.g. AccountHistory, ContactHistory__
__[customObjectName]__History e.g. Car__History, Brand__History__

```
SELECT OldValue, NewValue, Parent.Id, Parent.name, Parent.customfield__c
FROM foo__history

SELECT Name, customfield__c, (SELECT OldValue, NewValue FROM foo__history)
FROM foo__c
```

#### Chatter objects
[Awesome Chatter Documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/An_Introduction_to_Salesforce_Chatter)

[Chatter data Model](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/RelationshipsOfChatterObjects.htm)


  - A feed item is an entry in the feed, such as a change to a record that's being followed, an updated post, or a user status change.
  - All feed items have a ParentId, which is either:
    - a record
    - a user
    - a group
